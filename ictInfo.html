          Elon Musk debuts Tesla robot, Optimus, calling it a ‘fundamental
          transformation’<br /><br />

          Musk said he wants the robot to be manufactured at scale, sold for
          less than $20,000, and encompass core physical capabilities, such as
          the ability to move all fingers independently, and opposable thumbs
          with degrees of freedom so it can operate tools.<br /><br />

          “This means a future of abundance,” he said. “A future where there is
          no poverty. Where people … You can have whatever you want in terms of
          products and services.”<br /><br />

          “It really is a fundamental transformation of civilization as we know
          it,” he said.

          Unlocking 5G’s potential with network slicing<br /><br />

          As communication service providers look to find new revenue
          opportunities, we assess how network slicing could be the key to
          unlocking its potential<br />
          The integration of 5G networks is progressing rapidly every day. A
          huge improvement on 4G speeds, 5G opens up numerous opportunities
          while removing network congestion and <br />enabling us to connect
          with each other and the world with ease.<br /><br />

          As it offers higher bandwidth, lower latency and reliable wireless
          internet connections, 5G wireless technologies have the potential to
          transform several industries and consumer <br />experiences. Due to
          this, Shamik Mishra, Chief Technology Officer Connectivity at
          Capgemini Engineering, explains: “Machine-to-machine communication and
          connectivity for <br />critical infrastructures like public safety,
          manufacturing and ports can now reliably interconnect devices, taking
          the full benefit of data and cloud to deliver new revenues,
          <br />better productivity and new experiences.”<br /><br />

          With 4G generations and previous wireless networks, all devices
          received the same service, but, as different industries have different
          requirements for their networks, it would <br />be more effective for
          the customer if the networks were differentiated.<br /><br />

          “Network slicing is a concept built into 5G standards by 3GPP, which
          makes this differentiation of service possible. Telecom operators can
          now create several distinct, virtual, <br />independent networks
          within the same physical network, each catering to a different kind of
          service,” says Mishra.<br /><br />

          “For example, operators can now offer separate networks for connected
          vehicles as compared to industrial automation. This makes it more
          flexible for operators to deliver services <br />and provides
          increased reliability to their enterprise consumers, guaranteeing
          different on-demand service levels,” he adds.<br /><br />

          To remain competitive, communication service providers (CSPs) are now
          looking for ways to unlock opportunities in 5G, following its
          successful launch to identify new revenue <br />streams and find new
          ways to monetise network investments further.<br /><br />

          “Network slicing allows CSPs to create major new value for their
          customers. It also opens new partnering opportunities with Cloud
          Service and Infrastructure Providers. Through <br />automation,
          operators can provide new services with cost efficiency and
          scalability. The role of management automation becomes especially
          important when the number of <br />customers and slices increases,”
          comments Mika Uusitalo, Head of New Technologies and Innovation at
          Nokia.<br /><br />

          “Network slicing provides CSPs with an efficient way to package
          valuable network capabilities into differentiated, SLA-based services
          in a cost-effective way that can drive <br />profitable growth,” he
          adds.<br /><br />

          Essentially, network slicing is a form of architecture that offers the
          possibility of creating several customised virtual networks on a
          common shared physical infrastructure, <br />depending on the specific
          needs of applications, services, devices, customers or carriers. It
          allows multiple logical networks to be run as virtually independent
          business <br />operations on a single common physical infrastructure,
          efficiently and cost-effectively.<br /><br />

          The introduction of network slicing has the potential to optimise
          infrastructure utilisation and resource allocation.<br /><br />

          Improving 5G efficiency with network slicing<br /><br />
          With network slicing, giving dedicated bandwidth to users at the edge
          of the network without having to build private systems over a wide
          area results in a network more responsive <br />to the customers'
          needs.<br />

          It is now possible, for example, to provide an in-person augmented
          reality gaming experience for consumers at the edge of the network,
          delivered through the edge cloud and <br />without building specific
          radio systems in a physical location to support it. <br /><br />

          “Network slicing is all about offering service-level-driven services.
          These services are based on giving customers dedicated bandwidth
          and/or low latency capacity for services <br />that span the RAN, edge
          and cloud, ultimately making their offerings more customisable based
          on their customers' unique needs. <br /><br />

          “It also allows CSPs to create additional revenue-generating offerings
          and targeted services for key verticals like Blue Lights providers,
          where network availability and latency <br />are vital
          considerations,” notes Ian Goetz, Global Lead, RAN Systems Architect
          5G at Dell Technologies.<br /><br />

          According to GSMA’s Chief Technology Officer, Alex Sinclair, network
          slicing has become a prominent feature of 5G because it allows
          customers to enjoy connectivity and data <br />processing tailored to
          their specific needs and business requirements. This is particularly
          important in the 5G era, as different industry verticals are seeking
          to leverage the <br />power of technology to boost productivity.
          <br /><br />

          “The ability to customise network capabilities also greatly improves
          operational efficiency, cutting down on the time-to-market for
          products and services,” explains Sinclair.<br /><br />

          “Additionally, network slicing allows businesses to increase the
          security measures for slices that handle more sensitive processes. It
          provides greater defences against <br />cyber-attacks, since breaches
          can be isolated to a single slice,” he adds.<br />

          This is particularly significant, as the introduction of 5G has
          brought new cybersecurity challenges for security professionals. 5G’s
          software-based systems have more traffic <br />routing points than 4G
          and have multiple unregulated entry points to the network, which can
          allow hackers access to location tracking and even cellular reception
          for logged-in users.<br /><br />

          Automation and the future of network slicing<br /><br />
          As operators may be expected to maintain up to thousands of network
          slices, automation will be essential to the infrastructure needed if
          network slicing is going to unlock the <br />potential of 5G in the
          future. <br /><br />

          “Automation technology will be used to manage slice lifecycle, traffic
          load, service requirements and network resourcing changes in
          real-time,” says Sinclair. “To put it simply, <br />automation and the
          ability to quickly create slices could pave the way for operators to
          dynamically package and repackage network capabilities for different
          customers. This <br />is the end goal of network slicing.”<br /><br />

          The GSMA estimates network slicing will be worth US$300bn to operators
          by 2025, with the bulk of revenue coming from enterprises such as
          manufacturing, automotive and logistics.<br /><br />

          Acknowledging this prediction, Nokia’s Uusitalo concludes: “We will
          also see some revenue from consumer services, such as delivering
          broadband using 5G fixed wireless networks <br />and providing cloud
          gaming. Slicing in both 5G and 4G networks will bring value to a wide
          range of new use cases in energy, transportation, smart traffic,
          manufacturing, <br />public sector, ports, smart city, business
          applications, virtual reality, augmented reality, high-quality video
          streaming and cloud gaming, among others.”<br /><br />
